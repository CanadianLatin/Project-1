# Impacts of Covid19 Pandemic â€“ Health and Social-Economics

In this project we intend to analyze data from Our World In Data and World Bank.
How the lockdowns affected the number of cases (deaths/recoveries) in the world,
Compare differences between the approach towards the lockdowns in different countries, number of days in lockdown, type of lockdown.
Graph progression of cases, in relation to the progression of the lockdown.
Compare Covid stats on top 5 GDP countries to bottom 5 and analyze how that could have impacted it.
Compare countries with the most cases to find correlations.
